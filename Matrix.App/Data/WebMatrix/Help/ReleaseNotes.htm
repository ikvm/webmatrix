                                        This list includes the a brief description of the new features available in Version
                                        0.6 and the set of high-priority bugs that have been fixed.

                                        <li>
                                            You can now use database tools with Microsoft Access .mdb databases. You can create
                                            or delete tables, modify the table schemas, and edit table data. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The interface is redesigned to provide a consistent UI for editing both Access and
                                            SQL Server and MSDE databases. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            You can drag Access tables into a Web Forms (.aspx, .ascx) page. The behavior is similar
                                            to that of SQL Server tables - Web Matrix creates an instance of the <b>MxDataGrid</b> control,
                                            but bound to an instance of an <b>AccessDataSourceControl</b> object. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Data code builders (now called Code Wizards) work against both Access and SQL Server
                                            databases. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            You can open tables and stored procedures as documents and use Web Matrix to work
                                            on them. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Database connections are persisted between Web Matrix sessions. 
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Web Forms and HTML Editing</strong> 
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Table editing has been enhanced. You can insert rows and columns and merge or split
                                            cells. Although you can't visually select multiple cells, you can merge adjacent cells
                                            together to create complex tables. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            User controls now render their layout in Design view when used in an .aspx or .ascx
                                            document, instead of displaying a gray block. You can also refresh or edit the layout
                                            using command links in the Properties window. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Support has been added for editing inline CSS style attributes. You can edit the font
                                            and background CSS attributes of any HTML element using commands on the <b>Format</b> menu
                                            or by editing the element's <b>style</b> property. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            You can copy and paste content between Design view and HTML (or Source) view. 
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Source Code Editing</strong> 
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>

                                            The <b>Find</b> and <b>Replace</b> commands have been enhanced. The editor supports
                                            F3. The <b>Find &amp; Replace</b> dialog box is automatically populated with selected
                                            text in the editor, and it can remember previous searches. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Language-specific options have been added to allow you to control tab size and whether
                                            tabs should be converted to spaces. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Language-specific options have been added that control how to render whitespace and
                                            whether to trim trailing whitespace. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The <b>Go To Line</b> dialog box is initialized with the current line. 
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li>
                                            FTP connections and folder shortcuts are persisted between Web Matrix sessions as
                                            part of your workspace. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            FTP connections have been made more robust in terms of handling variances across FTP
                                            server implementations. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            FTP connections now support Web roots, which is useful when your Web directory is
                                            a subfolder within your FTP directory. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            You can open multiple files at a time using the <b>File|Open</b> command. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The <b>File Open</b> dialog box picks up the location of the currently active document
                                            (if there is one) as its initial location. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The Workspace window immediately displays new files or folders added to an open folder,
                                            without requiring a refresh. 
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                            Web Matrix now supports programming languages besides C# and Visual Basic .NET. Support has
                                            been added for J#, which is offered as a language option when you create class
                                            files or for code in Web Forms and other ASP.NET file types.

                                        <strong>Undo command</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undo is partially implemented for Design
                                        view. Currently, the <b>Undo</b> command is enabled and works for general HTML editing.
                                        However, it may not work as expected when used with ASP.NET server controls or table
                                        editing. For those scenarios try hitting undo multiple times. Undo/redo works fine in

                                        is dropped in the document again, the directive will not be re-added.&nbsp; The workaround
                                        is to switch to another view, switch back to All view, and then to drop the control

                                        a Web page in Design view does not generate <code>Page_Load</code> event handler.
                                        To create a <code>Page_Load</code> method, select <b>Page</b> from the drop-down list
                                        at the top of the Properties window, click the Event button (yellow lightning bolt),
                                        and then double-click in the box for the <b>Load</b> event in the grid.

                                        a Web server control from one document to another document in Web Matrix, the control
                                        is always deleted from the source document.

                                        in a Web page, you must copy the assemblies from the \Components directory of your
                                        Web Matrix installation to the \bin directory of your Web application. Alternatively,
                                        you can install the assembly into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).
